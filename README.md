<!-- Who am I?-->
Hello there and welcome! 
I'm Josh, a full-stack engineer based in Utah, recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Weber State University, and looking for opportunities to get outside my comfort zone and grow.

Looking to contribute to some open-source projects as well as continue working on a few personal projects I have:
  - RON (A web scraper web extension with AI integration)
  - A Recipe and food app to help users with allergies
  - BitCrypt, a fun interactive game that will be coming soon.

In addition, I teach a Web Development course with SLTech. If you are interested in learning web development and trying out our courses, contact me! 
If you need a custom website for yourself or your business again, please contact me!
